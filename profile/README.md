# ASRBench: Evaluate, compare and find the best model for audio transcription.

ASRBench is a framework developed in Python for creating and running benchmarks 
of audio transcription systems. It allows researchers and developers to compare 
different transcription systems in terms of accuracy, performance and resource 
utilization.

The ASRBench organization brings together projects that facilitate the evaluation 
of transcription systems, including an extensible framework and a command-line 
interface (CLI) for simple and efficient benchmark execution.

## Features

- Simplified configuration: Everything works from a single YAML configuration file, 
making the process intuitive and agile.
- Extensible framework: Customize benchmarks to meet your specific needs.
- CLI: Run benchmarks quickly with pre-configured systems.
- Comprehensive comparison: Evaluate different systems with detailed metrics.

## Projects in the Organization

### ASRBench Framework

The core of ASRBench, responsible for providing the structure for configuring and 
running customized benchmarks.

### ASRBench CLI

A command line interface that facilitates the execution of benchmarks with simple 
configurations and support for already implemented transcription systems.
